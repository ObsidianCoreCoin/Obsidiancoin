Obsidian Network
=============

Introduction
-----

Obsidian is the outcome of collaborative efforts to create a viable alternative 
currency akin to Litecoin. Our aim was to develop a coin that occupies a 
position between Litecoin and Bitcoin – bronze to Litecoin’s silver and 
Litecoin's silver equivalent to Bitcoin's gold.
 
While several alternative currencies have emerged over time, 
each bringing innovation, they also encountered various issues. 

Obsidian represents a peer-to-peer Internet currency facilitating instant, 
nearly cost-free global payments. As an open-source, decentralized payment 
network, Obsidian operates without central authorities.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run obsidian-qt.exe.
Or run the setup and run Obsidian directly from the programs' shortcut.
